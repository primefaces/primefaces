## Getting started with the MenuButton
MenuButton consists of one ore more menuitems. Following menubutton example has three
menuitems, first one is used triggers an action with ajax, second one does the similar but without
ajax and third one is used for redirect purposes.

```xhtml
<p:menuButton value="Options">
    <p:menuitem value="Save" action="#{bean.save}" update="comp" />
    <p:menuitem value="Update" action="#{bean.update}" ajax="false" />
    <p:menuitem value="Go Home" url="/home.jsf" />
</p:menuButton>
```
## Dynamic Menus
Menus can be created programmatically as well, see the dynamic menus part in menu component
section for more information and an example.

## Accessibility

When the menu contains more than a few items, the height of the overlay may grow taller than the available height of the browser's viewport. Even when the height is smaller, part of the overlay may still end up outside the viewport, as by default the overlay is rendered at the current position of the menu button. 

If the body of your web page is scrollable, this is not an issue, users can scroll down to see the remaining entries. However, it is also common to use a layout where the body of the web page takes up 100% of the available height and is not scrollable. Then users may end up with no way of accessing some entries of the overlay menu. In this case, please consider using the `collision` and `maxHeight` options to ensure the overlay menu is always within the bounds of the viewport:

```xhtml
<p:menuButton value="Options" collision="flipfit" maxHeight="90vh">
    <!-- many menuitems -->
</p:menuButton>
```
