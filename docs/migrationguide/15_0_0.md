## Deleted

  * Deleted `Chart.js` legacy components and Java models as its been deprecated since 14.0.0
  * Deleted `InputSwitch` as its been deprecated since 10.0.0

  * Deleted long time deprecated `primefaces.LEGACY_WIDGET_NAMESPACE`
  * Removed additional themes from primefaces.jar (only saga is still there), you now need to include primefaces-themes.jar. Please check the docs. 

## Deprecated

  * `Separator` component is deprecated since 15.0.0, please switch to `Divider`.
  * `Spacer` component is deprecated since 15.0.0, please use any of the modern CSS methods of spacing. We are not deleting it as it's been around since PF 2.0 and used widely in applications.
  * The `allSuffix` attribute of the `importEnum` is deprecated since 15.0.0. Please use the special key `ALL_VALUES` to
    access all values, which is and was always available.
  * The themes saga, arya and vela are now called saga-blue, arya-blue and vela-blue. The old names are still supported but will removed in the next version.

## FilterMeta

  * `FilterMeta` has a new `normalize` property which is read from the Datatable/TreeTable `isFilterNormalize` property to handle diacritics.

## Core

  * Class `org.primefaces.component.api.UIData` was renamed `org.primefaces.component.api.PrimeUIData`.
  * Context param `primefaces.HTML5_COMPLIANCE` now defaults to `auto`.

## Calendar

  * `defaultMillisec` was renamed to `defaultMillisecond`.

## FeedReader

  * Switched from [Rome](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) library which uses XML parsing to non XML very fast [RSS Reader](https://github.com/w3stling/rssreader)

## FileUpload
  * `invalidSizeMessage`, `invalidFileMessage`, `fileLimitMessage` has been removed. PF i18n will be used for it.
  * `sizeLimit`, `fileLimit`, `allowTypes` has been removed. Please attach `p:validateFile` to the `p:fileUpload` component.

## InputNumber

  * `padControl` attribute was changed from `Boolean` to `String` to allow more flexibility. Allow padding the decimal places with zeros. If set to 'floats', padding is only done when there are some decimals (up to the number of decimal places from the decimalPlaces variable). If set to an integer, padding will use that number for adding the zeros. If set to "true" it will always pad the decimal places with zeroes, and never if set to "false". Default is "true"

## Showcase
  * Was migrated to Jakarta EE 10. Requires e.g. Jetty 12 and Java 17 to run stand-alone.
