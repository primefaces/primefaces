  * Deleted `InputSwitch` as its been deprecated since 10.0.0
  * Deleted **Apache Commons FileUpload** support for native uploading now that Servlet 3.0 is the minimum requirement.
  * Deleted `autocomplete="off"` from any hidden inputs as is recommended by w3c spec

## Deprecated

  * `Separator` component is deprecated since 15.0.0, please switch to `Divider`.
  * `Spacer` component is deprecated since 15.0.0, please use any of the modern CSS methods of spacing.

## Core

  * Class `org.primefaces.component.api.UIData` was renamed `org.primefaces.component.api.PrimeUIData`.
  * Context param `primefaces.HTML5_COMPLIANCE` now defaults to `auto`.

## FeedReader

  * Switched from [Rome](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) library which uses XML parsing to non XML very fast [RSS Reader](https://github.com/w3stling/rssreader)

## InputNumber

  * `padControl` attribute was changed from `Boolean` to `String` to allow more flexibility. Allow padding the decimal places with zeros. If set to 'floats', padding is only done when there are some decimals (up to the number of decimal places from the decimalPlaces variable). If set to an integer, padding will use that number for adding the zeros. If set to "true" it will always pad the decimal places with zeroes, and never if set to "false". Default is "true"

## Showcase
  * Was migrated to Jakarta EE 10. Requires e.g. Jetty 12 and Java 17 to run stand-alone.
