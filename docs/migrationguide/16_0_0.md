# Migration guide 15.0.0 -> 16.0.0

## Breaking Changes

### JSF / JavaEE / javax.* support

We completely removed the support of JSF and Java EE and all related javax.* packages.
This means our now baseline is Jakarta Faces 4.0 and newer.

### Client-side widgets

The client-side JavaScript code and build process had some refactorings. Most of this is internal and
will not affect end-users.

All widgets are now proper JavaScript classes. Two points to take note of:

* If you have hacks that modify existing PrimeFaces widgets, you may have to adjust these.
  Overriding prototype method such as `PrimeFaces.widget.SomeWidget.someMethod = function() {... }`
  should still work for the most part. If you need to call the super method from an overridden
  method, you can do so by accessing the prototype method directly, e.g.
  `Object.getPrototypeOf(PrimeFaces.widget.SelectOneMenu).prototype.someSuperMethod.call(this, ...)`.
* If you created custom PrimeFaces widgets that still use the old class emulation syntax,
  you will have to update them. For example, if your widget looks like this:

```js
PrimeFaces.widget.MyWidget = PrimeFaces.widget.DeferredWidget.extend({
    init: function(cfg) {
        this._super(cfg);
        // custom initialization
    },

    refresh: function(cfg) {
        this._super(cfg);
    },
});
```

Then you need to change it to this:

```js
class MyWidget extends PrimeFaces.widget.DeferredWidget {
    init(cfg) {
        super.init(cfg);
        // custom initialization
    }

    refresh(cfg) {
        super.refresh(cfg);
    }
});

PrimeFaces.widget.MyWidget = MyWidget;
```

### HTML5 compliance

we removed primefaces.HTML5_COMPLIANCE and Html5FacesContextFactory as its not required anymore with Faces 4.0. The HTML5 doctype is automatically detected from the xhtml.

### PrimeClientWindowLifecycleFactory has been removed

Please use this instead:

```xml
<faces-config>
    <factory>
        <client-window-factory>org.primefaces.clientwindow.PrimeClientWindowFactory</client-window-factory>
    </factory>
</faces-config>
```
