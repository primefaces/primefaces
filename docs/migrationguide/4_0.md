# Migration guide 3.5 -> 4.0

* MenuModel is rewritten and not backward compatible with the old version.
* DataTable sortBy and filterBy expressions require the plain property name meaning "name" instead of "#{person.name}". Backward compatibility is maintained for expressions like "#{var.property}" but not for complex expressions.
* FileUpload is reimplemented and it is backward compatible except "showButtons" option is removed. disabledSelection option of column, moved to DataTable, change is backward compatible and the option will be removed from column in a future release.
* AutoComplete: removed process/global/onstart/oncomplete in favor of "p:ajax event="query" process/global/onstart/oncomplete"
* Preferred way of accessing widgets is via PF('widgetVarName').show(), old way (e.g. widgetVarName.show()) is still supported and will be removed in a future version.
