## AutoComplete
  * Style class `ui-autocomplete-emptyMessage` renamed to `ui-autocomplete-empty-message`.

</dependency>
```

## Charts
- Chart.js 2.9.4 was replaced with Chart.js 3.2.1
- Chart.js comes with breaking changes. When you only work with PrimeFaces-Charts-components and classes most things should work as with PrimeFaces 10.
  For custom ChartJS-JavaScript (via ChartModel.setExtender) please take a look at https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html
- Following PrimeFaces API-changes were made to reflect changes within Chart.js 3 - JavaScript - API
  - `setLineTension` was renamed to `setTension` (`LineChartDataSet`, `RadarChartDataSet`, `ElementsLine`)
  - `LineChartDataSet#getSteppedLine` was renamed to `LineChartDataSet#getStepped`
  - `PolarAreaChartOptions#startAngle` was moved to `RadialScales#startAngle`

## DataTable
- LazyDataModel now requires to implemenet `int count(Map<String, FilterMeta> filterBy);`
    - therefore LazyDataModel doesnt need to call `setRowCount` anymore in the `load` method
    - and this workaround to recalculate `first` isnt required anymore: https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/1921

## Dialog
- Now `responsive="true"` by default.

## DefaultMenuItem
- Now `global="true"` by default.

## Media
- Adobe Flash player support has been removed.

## PhotoCam
- Adobe Flash player support has been removed.

## PrimeFlex 3

- PrimeFlex 3 is a breaking release. See https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex/migration
- It´s technically possible to add PrimeFlex 2 and PrimeFlex 3 to your project.
- PrimeFaces offers a CLI-tool to migrate your existing projects from PrimeFlex 2 to 3. See https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/tree/master/primefaces-cli
