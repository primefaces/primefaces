## Core
  * Facelet function `p:resolveWidgetVar` now returns the widget var name only, instead of `PF('widgetVarName')`.

## DataTable
**Removed**:
  - `DataTable#sortMeta` _(replaced by DataTable#sortBy)_
  - `DataTable#sortField` _(replaced by UIColumn#field)_
  - `DataTable#sortOrder` _(replaced by UIColumn#sortOrder)_
  - `DataTable#sortFunction` _(replaced by UIColumn#sortFunction)_
  - `DataTable#expandableRowGroups` _(replaced by HeaderRow#expandable)_
  - `DataTable#nullSortOrder` _(replaced by UIColumn#nullSortOrder)_
  - `DataTable#caseSensitiveSort` _(replaced by UIColumn#caseSensitiveSort)_

**Updated**
  - `DataTable#sortMode`: default value "multiple"
  - `DataTable#allowUnsorting`: default value "false"
  - `DataTable#sortBy`: expects a single or a collection of SortMeta _(default sorting can either be configured through markup or programmatically)_
  - `DataTable#filterBy`: expects a single or a collection of FilterMeta _(default sorting can either be configured through markup or programmatically)_

**Added**
  - `Column#sortPriority`: defines in which order columns sorter should apply initially
  - `Column#sortOrder`: defines default sort order
  - `Column#nullSortOrder`
  - `Column#caseSensitiveSort`

**Breaking changes**
  - `DataTable#sortBy`: no longer expect a Map, but a single or a collection of SortMeta _(use SortMeta#builder)_ `UIColumn#field` or `UIColumn#sortBy` must be set to enable default sorting.
  - `DataTable#filterBy`: no longer expect a Map, but a single or a collection of FilterMeta _(use FilterMeta#builder)_ `UIColumn#field` or `UIColumn#filterBy` must be set to enable default filtering.
  - As it is possible from now on to configure default sorted columns on a single sort mode datatable. Users will be expected to implement only one method `LazyDataModel#load(int first, int pageSize, Map<String, SortMeta> sortBy, Map<String, FilterMeta> filterBy)`
  - detects lazy-attribute automatically based on value-binding to LazyDataModel. So no need to set this explicit anymore.
  - `SortEvent`: sorted datatable value is no longer pass to this event, instead get the sorted value through your managed bean (e.g `YourBean#list` used as value expression)
  - `FilterEvent`: filtered datatable value is no longer pass to this event, instead get the filtered value through your managed bean (e.g `YourBean#filtered` used as value expression)

## TreeTable
**Removed**:
  - `TreeTable#sortOrder` _(replaced by UIColumn#sortOrder)_
  - `TreeTable#sortFunction` _(replaced by UIColumn#sortFunction)_
  - `TreeTable#caseSensitiveSort` _(replaced by UIColumn#caseSensitiveSort)_

**Updated**
  - `TreeTable#sortMode`: default value "multiple"
  - `TreeTable#allowUnsorting`: default value "false"
  - `TreeTable#sortBy`: expects a single or a collection of SortMeta _(default sorting can either be configured through markup or programmatically)_
  - `TreeTable#filterBy`: expects a single or a collection of FilterMeta _(default sorting can either be configured through markup or programmatically)_

**Added**
  - `Column#sortPriority`: defines in which order columns sorter should apply initially
  - `Column#sortOrder`: defines default sort order
  - `Column#nullSortOrder`
  - `Column#caseSensitiveSort`

**Breaking changes**
  - `TreeTable#filteredNode` has been renamed to `TreeTable#filteredValue`
  - `TreeTable#sortBy`: no longer expect a Map, but a single or a collection of SortMeta _(use SortMeta#builder)_ `UIColumn#field` or `UIColumn#sortBy` must be set to enable default sorting.
  - `TreeTable#filterBy`: no longer expect a Map, but a single or a collection of FilterMeta _(use FilterMeta#builder)_ `UIColumn#field` or `UIColumn#filterBy` must be set to enable default filtering.

## Column/Columns
  * `priority` has been renamed to `responsivePriority`

## Dock
  * Re-implemented using CSS. Deprecated props `itemWidth, maxWidth, proximity` for CSS instead. (https://primefaces.github.io/primefaces/10_0/#/components/dock)

## Diagram
  * `paintStyle` has changed from `setPaintStyle("{strokeStyle:'#98AFC7',fillStyle:'#5C738B',lineWidth:3}")` to `setPaintStyle("{stroke:'#98AFC7',fill:'#5C738B',strokeWidth:3}")`

## Dashboard
  * `disabled` attribute has been renamed into `reordering` for reordering panels
  * `disabled` attribute is now like all other disabled attributes to disable the component

## FileUpload
  * `FileUpload#performVirusScan` attribute has been renamed into `virusScan`
  * `VirusScanner#performVirusScan(InputStream in)` has been refactored into `VirusScanner#scan(UploadedFile file)`

## ChartJS
  * `offset` for Bar charts is no longer `true` by default see: (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/5726)

## Themes
  * **Removed** `aristo` theme and made `saga` the default theme

## Layout
  * **Removed** `Layout` component in favor or pure CSS. PF Extensions still has a similar Layout component

## Editor
  * **Removed** `Editor` component in favor `TextEditor`.

## InputMask
  * Optional section of mask no longer starts with `?` but must be wrapped in `[` and `]`.

## Schedule
  * The JavaScript library (FullCalendar) was updated to version 5. It uses a different DOM structure with potentially new or changed CSS style classes. Check if your custom CSS for the schedule still applies if you have any.
  * If you are using a custom `extender` function, check your JavaScript code: Many FullCalendar settings have been renamed or changed - see the FullCalendar upgrade guide at https://fullcalendar.io/docs/upgrading-from-v4
  * New Locale customization labels for `year, list, moreLinkText, noEventsText`
  * The schedule component has two properties `resizable` and `draggable` that were supposed to be used as the default for all events. Before  10.0, however, these two properties did not have any effect, as they were always overwritten by the `ScheduleEvent#isEditable` property. To remedy this, the `ScheduleEvent` interface now contains two new methods `ScheduleEvent#isResizable` and `ScheduleEvent#isDraggable` that should be used instead of the deprecated `ScheduleEvent#isEditable`. _Please note that these two methods may return null_, to indicate that they do not overwrite the default setting of the schedule. Likewise, the builder has `DefaultScheduleEvent.Builder#resizable` and `DefaultScheduleEvent.Builder#draggable`.
  * The event properties `resizable` and `draggable` default to `null`, and the schedule properties defaults to `true`. This means that, like previously, events are editable by default.

## Client-Side-Validation
  * `PrimeFaces.util.ValidationContext` now is `PrimeFaces.validation.ValidationContext`
  * `PrimeFaces.validation.ValidationContext` is now a real "context object" and most util methods has been moved to `PrimeFaces.validation.Utils`

## AutoComplete
  * Event `moreText` is renamed to `moreTextSelect`.
  * May consume REST-endpoints via `completeEndpoint` to eg improve performance. (https://primefaces.github.io/primefaces/10_0/#/components/autocomplete?id=consuming-rest-endpoints)

## DataView
  * detects lazy-attribute automatically based on value-binding to LazyDataModel. So no need to set this explicit anymore.

## DataList
  * detects lazy-attribute automatically based on value-binding to LazyDataModel. So no need to set this explicit anymore.

## DataGrid
  * detects lazy-attribute automatically based on value-binding to LazyDataModel. So no need to set this explicit anymore.

## DatePicker
  * showTime is detected automatically based on value-binding to LocalDateTime. timeOnly is detected automatically based on value-binding to LocalTime. In this usecases you don´t need to set this attributes explicit when you are happy with this default-behavior.

## Cache
  * HazelCast now requires version 4.X see: (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/5989)

## DataExporter
  * PDF library has been switched from iText to Libre OpenPDF: (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/5749)
  * PDF can now be set in Portrait Mode to fit more columns: (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/6425)
  * PDF/Excel can now align columns by setting `style` or `styleClass` on `p:column`: (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/6430)
  * supports AJAX (so ajax="false" is not required anymore)
  * Interface `org.primefaces.component.export.Exporter` and abstract class `org.primefaces.component.datatable.export.DataTableExporter` had been modified.
    `org.primefaces.component.datatable.export.DataTableExporter` provides `getOutputStream()`. Custom exporters need to append to `getOutputStream()`.
    (see https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces-showcase/commit/e6ed9ddeb4a4221af2968e237b3ef6c5c1b7576c as an example.)
