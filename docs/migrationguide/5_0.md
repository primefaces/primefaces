# Migration guide 4.0 -> 5.0

* Chart components are deprecated in favor of new generic chart component with new Chart API. Old chart components are still supported but will be removed in a future release.
* ToolbarGroup deprecated, use left and right facets of toolbar instead. (Reverted back as of 5.0.1, both facets and toolbar groups will be supported instead)
* Defining fields in sortBy-filterBy attributes is deprecated use a value expression instead.e.g. sortBy="#{user.name}" instead of sortBy="name"
* DataTable frozen rows feature take an integer value instead of a collection from now on. This value defined how many rows from the start should be frozen.
* LazyDataModel's filters parameter changed to Map<String,Object> instead of Map<String,String> as a requirement of the new Advanced Filtering Feature.
* Dialog: appendToBody was removed in favor of appendTo="@(body)" to gain more flexibility
* Watermark: forElement was removed in favor of for="@(yourSelector)"
* Widgets must be referenced via "PF". e.g. PF('widgetVarName').show() instead of widgetVarName.show();
* DataTable layout changed to table-layout:fixed.
* PrimeFaces Push is reimplemented, PushContext is deprecated, use EventBus instead along with the new Push API.
* ScrollPanel is reimplemented, usage is backward compatible however UI is slightly different.
