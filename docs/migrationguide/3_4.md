# Migration guide 3.3 -> 3.4

* Tree components dom structure has been reimplemented, if you have overwritten trees look and feel, check for compatibility issues.
* RightClick event to open a contextMenu on datatable does not invoke rowSelect ajax behavior event anymore, use dedicated contextMenu event instead.
* DataTable filtering requires filteredValue reference in backing bean, for backwards compatibility if this reference is not defined, filtering will work using view state however this is a fallback and will be removed in future releases.
* Default event of overlayPanel is changed from mousedown to click.
* DataTable widget's clearFilters client side method, now does an ajax call to clear the filters and update the table compared to just clearing filters on client side in prior versions.
* Dialogs on IE7 have fixed widths to overcome IE7 auto width bugs. height attribute of selectCheckboxMenu is renamed to scrollHeight.
* DataExporter's excludeColumns is replaced by exportable attribute of column. effectDuration of selectOneMenu renamed to effectSpeed.
* partialSubmit is now false by default. It can be globally configured using primefaces.SUBMIT context parameter and components can override the global setting with provided partialSubmit attribute.
* RequestContext is also available for non-ajax requests as well.
