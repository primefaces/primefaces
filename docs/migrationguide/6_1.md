# Migration guide 6.0 -> 6.1

## Core
* Search Expression Framework (SEF): SEF was aligned with JSF 2.3 and @next, @previous and @child now skips plain HTML markup.

## OutputLabel
* If you use p:outputLabel, which targets a composite component, the composite component must use cc:editableValueHolder to identify the target input component. NOTE: a label must actually target a input component! If you don't use cc:editableValueHolder, a NPE will occur. See https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/2163.

## Tree
* DefaultTreeNode equals/hashCode has been changed to include the rowKey, this could break your code. See: https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/1433
