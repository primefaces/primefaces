# Migration guide 11.0.0 -> 12.0.0

## DataTable
  * Row select mode `checkbox` is now `none`.
  * Filter match mode `range` has been removed. Use `between`.

## Captcha
  * Is now theme aware. The default value of `theme` is now `auto` so it will attempt to detect your current theme and set it to `light` or `dark`
  
## Charts
  * `beginAtZero` has moved from `CartesianLinearTicks` to `CartesianLinearAxes`
  * `scales.axes.scaleLabel.labelString` in `CartesianScaleLabel` was renamed to `scales.title.text` in `CartesianScaleTitle`
  * `scales.axes.ticks.suggestedMax` was renamed to `scales.axes.suggestedMax`
  * `scales.axes.ticks.suggestedMin` was renamed to `scales.axes.suggestedMin`
  
## Printer
  * `title` has been removed and you can set the title with the `configuration` property like `configuration="title: 'Nature Image Header', timeout: 1000"`
  
## TextEditor
  * Is now theme aware. If you are using legacy theme or no theme you may need to add CSS variables to your stylesheet to support it (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/8064)

## Tree
  * State classes and events are transferred from label to content (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/8339)
