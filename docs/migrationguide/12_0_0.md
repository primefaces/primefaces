# Migration guide 11.0.0 -> 12.0.0

## DataTable
  * Filter match mode `range` has been removed. Use `between`.

## TextEditor
  * Is now theme aware. If you are using legacy theme or no theme you may need to add CSS variables to your stylesheet to support it (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/8064)
