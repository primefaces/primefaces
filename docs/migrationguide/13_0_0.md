# Migration guide 12.0.0 -> 13.0.0

## Core
  * Internet Explorer support has been completely removed
  * Font Open Sans `/font/open-sans-v13-latin` has been removed
  * DefaultStreamedContent now allows for `long` instead of `int` sized streams
  
## Deleted
  * `Chart` in favor of `Charts`
  * `Lightbox` in favor of `Galleria`
  * `Ring` in favor of `Carousel`
  * `ContentFlow` in favor of `Carousel`
  * `p:repeat` in favor of `ui:repeat` (both Mojarra and MyFaces support what this used to do)

## Deprecated
  * `Watermark` in favor passthrough attribute `pt:placeholder` or vanilla JS
  * `SelectOneRadio` tabular layout in favor of responsive layout
  * `SelectManyCheckbox` tabular layout in favor of responsive layout
  * `DataGrid` tabular layout in favor of responsive layout `layout="grid"` now the default
  * `PanelGrid` tabular layout in favor of responsive layout `layout="grid"` now the default. To fall back to legacy behavior set `layout="tabular" columns="0"`

## Chips
  * `separator` attribute is now `null` by default.
  
## Dashboard
  * Adding `responsive` mode has caused some re-factoring of the model specifically `DashboardColumn` to `DashboardWidget`.
  * Dashboard models have been moved from `org.primefaces.model` to `org.primefaces.model.dashboard`.

## SelectCheckboxMenu
  * `scrollHeight` type is now `String` instead of `Integer` (to also support the use of `vh` and `%` CSS units).
