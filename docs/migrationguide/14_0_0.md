  * `<p:barChart>` now uses `List<Object>` instead of `List<Number>`
  
## ColumnToggler

  *  AJAX `toggle` event is now `org.primefaces.event.ColumnToggleEvent` giving access to `UIColumn` that was toggled

## DatePicker/Calendar

  * Locale `firstDay` renamed `firstDayOfWeek` to match other Prime libraries

## DataTable

  * Using Column custom `sortFunction` signature change now requires a third parameter `SortMeta` like `public int sortByModel(Object car1, Object car2, SortMeta sortMeta)`
  * `JpaLazyDataModel` renamed to `JPALazyDataModel`
  * `JPALazyDataModel`: deprecated constructors, use `JPALazyDataModel.builder()` instead

### DataTable Selection

Few selection attributes have been renamed for consistency purposes:
  * `rowSelectMode` renamed to `selectionRowMode`
  * `disabledSelection` renamed to `selectionDisabled`
  * `disabledTextSelection` renamed to `selectionTextDisabled`
  * `UIColumn#selectionMode` renamed to `selectionBox` and reworked. Since [13.0.0](https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/10129), `DataTable#selectionMode` is automatically deduced from `selection` value binding.
  
!> Starting from 14.0.0, `DataTable#selectionMode` will be the single source of truth to configure whether selection should be `single` or `multiple`. To configure selection column, e.g display radiobutton or checkbox, `UIColumn#selectionBox` should be set to true. Whether it's a radiobutton or checkbox will depend on `DataTable#selectionMode`

## FileUpload

  * `invalidSizeMessage`, `invalidFileMessage`, `fileLimitMessage` are deprecated and will be removed in 15.0.0. PF i18n will be used for it.
  * `maxFileSize`, `fileLimit`, `allowedTypes` are deprecated and will be removed in 15.0.0. Please attach `p:validateFile` to the `p:fileUpload` component.
  * Simple FileUpload: Client side validation has been reimplemented with PrimeFaces CSV and support for `p:message(s)`/`p:growl`. Please make sure to enable CSV to use it.
  * Simple FileUpload: filename is not displayed by default when `auto=true`, set `displayFilename=true` instead if you need it.
