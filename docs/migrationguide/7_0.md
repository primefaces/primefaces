# Migration guide 6.2 -> 7.0

## REMOVED
* Push has been removed. Please use the JSF2.3 socket or OmniFaces now.
* Mobile has been removed in favor of responsive features.

## Core
* RequestContext has been replaced by PrimeFaces.current(). RequestContext is still available as PrimeRequestContext but it's internal PrimeFaces API and should therefore be avoided to use.
* autoUpdate attribute of outputPanel, fragment, messages and growl has been removed. Use p:autoUpdate instead.
* OverlayPanel: appendToBody has been removed. Use appendTo="@(body)" instead.
* Button/Link/MenuItem: The url/href attribute isn't automatically prepended by contextPath anymore. Use the outcome attribute for referencing JSF views in the same application or manually prepend url/href with #{request.contextPath}. See https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/3506.

## Datatable
* `rowsPerPageTemplate` Star `*` support removed. Use `{ShowAll|'*'}` instead.
