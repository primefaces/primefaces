# Repeat

`p:repeat` is a fork of the Mojarra `ui:repeat` to provide/backport important bugfixes for users, which must stay on older Mojarra versions.
If you don't have problems with `ui:repeat`, please **do not** use `p:repeat`.


!> Apache MyFaces does not require p:repeat.

!> Mojarra 2.3.18, 3.0.3, and 4.0+ have resolved all issues with repeat that necessitated this component. See  [`eclipse-ee4j/mojarra#4957`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/issues/4957)
