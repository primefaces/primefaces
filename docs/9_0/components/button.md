## Getting Started with Button
p:button usage is same as standard h:button, an outcome is necessary to navigate using GET
requests. Assume you are at source.xhtml and need to navigate target.xhtml.

```xhtml
<p:button outcome="target" value="Navigate"/>
```
## Parameters
Parameters in URI are defined with nested <f:param /> tags.

```xhtml
<p:button outcome="target" value="Navigate">
    <f:param name="id" value="10" />
</p:button>
```
## Icons
Icons for button are defined via css and _icon_ attribute, if you use title instead of value, only icon
will be displayed and title text will be displayed as tooltip on mouseover. You can also use icons
from PrimeFaces themes such ui-icon-check.

```xhtml
<p:button outcome="target" icon="star" value="With Icon"/>
<p:button outcome="target" icon="star" title="With Icon"/>
```
```css
.star {
    background-image: url("images/star.png");
}
```
## Skinning
Button renders a _button_ tag which _style_ and _styleClass_ applies. As skinning style classes are global,
see the main theming section for more information. Following is the list of structural style classes;

| Class | Applies | 
| --- | --- | 
| .ui-button | Button element
| .ui-button-text-only | Button element when icon is not used
| .ui-button-text | Label of button
