## Getting started with RemoteCommand
RemoteCommand is used by invoking the command from your javascript code.

```xhtml
<p:remoteCommand name="increment" action="#{counter.increment}" out="count" />
<h:outputText id="count" value="#{counter.count}" />
```
```js
<script type="text/javascript">
    function customfunction() {
        //your custom code
        increment(); //makes a remote call
    }
</script>
```
That’s it whenever you execute your custom javascript function(eg customfunction()), a remote call
will be made, actionListener is processed and output text is updated. Note that remoteCommand
must be nested inside a form.


## Passing Parameters
Remote command can send dynamic parameters in the following way;

```js
increment([{name:'x', value:10}, {name:'y', value:20}]);
```
