# specifying other dists doesn't make sense because `trusty` doesn't have `oraclejdk8` (fails due to `Sorry, but JDK '[oraclejdk8]' is not known.`) which is the only supported JDK currently. Testing on Mac OSX doesn't make too much sense since it will run the same `maven` based build routine.

jdk:
- oraclejdk8
- openjdk8
# - openjdk7  (not possible since JSF 2.3 dependency - we need to compile it)

install:
- git clone https://github.com/primefaces/maven-jsf-plugin && cd maven-jsf-plugin && mvn install && cd ..

script:
- mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true --batch-mode --show-version
# add --update-snapshots if snapshots are used
- mvn test verify --batch-mode
