# specifying other dists doesn't make sense because `trusty` doesn't have `oraclejdk8` (fails due to `Sorry, but JDK '[oraclejdk8]' is not known.`) which is the only supported JDK currently. Testing on Mac OSX doesn't make too much sense since it will run the same `maven` based build routine.

jdk:
- oraclejdk8
- openjdk8
# - openjdk7  (not possible since JSF 2.3 dependency - we need to compile it)

script:
# add --update-snapshots if snapshots are used
- mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true --batch-mode --show-version
# the following command line builds the project, runs the tests with coverage and then execute the SonarCloud analysis
- if [[ "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" = "false" ]]; then mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install sonar:sonar; fi
