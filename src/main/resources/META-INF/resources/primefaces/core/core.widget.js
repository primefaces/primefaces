     * framework and should not be created manually.
     * 
     * There are a few base classes defined by PrimeFaces that you can use when writing the client-side part of your
     * custom widget:
     * 
     * - {@link BaseWidget}: Base class that you should extend if you do not required any advanced functionality.
     * - {@link DeferredWidget}: When you widget needs to be initialized on the client in a way does required the
     * element to be visible, you can use this class as a base. A widget may not be visible, for example, when it is
     * inside a dialog or tab. The deferred widget provides the the method {@link DeferredWidget.addDeferredRender}
     * (to register a listener) and {@link DeferredWidget.renderDeferred} (to render the widget once it is visible).
     * - {@link DynamicOverlayWidget}: When your widget is an overlay with dynamically loaded content, you can use this
     * base class.
     * 
     * Note to TypeScript users: you could use these widget classes to check whether a widget instance is of a certain
     * type:

     * BaseWidget for the PrimeFaces widgets framework.
     * 
     * It provides some common functionality for other widgets. All widgets should inherit from this class, or an
     * appropriate sub class in the following manner:
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * class MyWidget extends PrimeFaces.widget.BaseWidget {
     *

     * 
     *   // more methods required by your widget
     * 
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * Or, alternatively, if you need to support old browsers and do not wish to transpile your code:
     * 
     * ```javascript
     * PrimeFaces.widget.MyWidget = PrimeFaces.widget.BaseWidget.extend({
     *   init: function(cfg) {
     *     this._super(cfg);
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     * 
     * If your widget needs to be visible before it can be rendered, consider using the {@link DeferredWidget} as a
     * base class instead.
     * 
     * @typedef PrimeFaces.widget.RefreshListener A refresh listener for a PrimeFaces widget. It is invoked when the
     * widget is reloaded, such as during AJAX updates. Use {@link BaseWidget.addRefreshListener} to add a refresh
     * listener.
     * @template PrimeFaces.widget.RefreshListener.TWidget The type of the widget that is being refreshed.
     * @this {TWidget} PrimeFaces.widget.RefreshListener
     * @param {TWidget} PrimeFaces.widget.RefreshListener.widget The widget that is being refreshed.
     * 
     * @typedef PrimeFaces.widget.DestroyListener A destroy listener for a PrimeFaces widget. It is invoked when the
     * widget is removed, such as during AJAX updates. Use {@link BaseWidget.addDestroyListener} to add a destroy
     * listener.
     * @template PrimeFaces.widget.DestroyListener.TWidget The type of the widget that is being destroyed.
     * @this {TWidget} PrimeFaces.widget.DestroyListener
     * @param {TWidget} PrimeFaces.widget.DestroyListener.widget The widget that is being destroyed.

     * object for this widget.
     * 
     * @prop {PrimeFaces.PartialWidgetCfg<TCfg>} cfg The configuration of this widget instance. Please note that
     * no property is guaranteed to be present, you should always check for `undefined` before accessing a property.
     * This is partly because the value of a property is not transmitted from the server to the client when it equals
     * the default.
     * @prop {string | string[]} id The client-side ID of this widget, with all parent naming containers, such as
     * `myForm:myWidget`. This is also the ID of the container HTML element for this widget. In case the widget needs
     * multiple container elements (such as {@link Paginator}), this may also be an array if IDs.
     * @prop {JQuery} jq The jQuery instance of the container element of this widget. In case {@link id} is an array, it
     * will contain multiple elements. Please note that some widgets have got not DOM elements at all, in this case this
     * will be an empty jQuery instance.
     * @prop {string} jqId A CSS selector for the container element (or elements, in case {@link id} is an array) of
     * this widget, This is usually an ID selector (that is properly escaped). You can select the container element or
     * elements like this: `$(widget.jqId)`.

     * access a widget instance by calling `PF('myWidgetVar')`.
     * 
     * @interface {PrimeFaces.widget.BaseWidgetCfg} cfg The configuration for the {@link  BaseWidget| BaseWidget widget}.
     * You can access this configuration via {@link PrimeFaces.widget.BaseWidget.cfg|BaseWidget.cfg}. Please note that this
     * configuration is usually meant to be read-only and should not be modified. This configuration is
     * always accessible via the `cfg` property of a widget and consists of key-value pairs. Please note that, in order
     * to save bandwidth, the server only sends a value for a given configuration key when the value differs from the
     * default value. That is, you must expect any configuration value to be absent and make sure you check for its
     * presence before accessing it.
     * 
     * @prop {Record<string, PrimeFaces.Behavior>} cfg.behaviors A map with all behaviors that
     * were defined for this widget. The key is the name of the behavior, the value is the callback function that is

     * `myForm:myWidget`. This is also the ID of the container HTML element for this widget. In case the widget needs
