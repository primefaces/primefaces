/**
 * Namespace for the rangy TouchSwipe plugin.
 * 
 * Contains some additional types and interfaces required for the typings.
 * 
 * A jQuery plugin to be used on touch devices such as iPad, iPhone, Android etc.
 * 
 * Detects single and multiple finger swipes, pinches and falls back to mouse 'drags' on the desktop.
 * 
 * Time and distance thresholds can be set to distinguish between swipe gesture and slow drag.
 * 
 * Allows exclusion of child elements (interactive elements) as well allowing page scrolling or page zooming depending on configuration.
 * 
 * See https://github.com/mattbryson/TouchSwipe-Jquery-Plugin.
