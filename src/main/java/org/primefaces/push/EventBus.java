/**
 * A distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple PushEndpoint instances. The event bus implements publish / subscribe and point to point messaging.
 * Messages sent over the event bus can be of any type. For publish / subscribe, messages can be published to a Java class annotated with the {@link org.primefaces.push.annotation.PushEndpoint#value}
 * using one of the method annotated with {@link org.atmosphere.handler.OnMessage}.
 * <p/>
 * {@link org.primefaces.push.annotation.PushEndpoint} are registered against a path, defined using the {@link org.primefaces.push.annotation.PushEndpoint#value}. There can be multiple PushEndpoint registered against each path,
 * and a particular PushEndpoint can be registered against multiple paths. The event bus will route a sent message to all PushEndpoint which are registered against that path.
 * When sending a message, a {@link Reply} can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver has been completed.
 * Instances of EventBus are thread-safe.
