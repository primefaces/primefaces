/**
 * An object that can be used to emulate classes and a class hierarchy in JavaScript. This works even for old
 * browsers that do no support the native `class` syntax yet. Note however, that this should be mostly compatible
 * with the new `class` syntax of JavaScript, so consider creating your own widgets as a class:
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * class MyWidget extends PrimeFaces.widget.BaseWidget {
 *   init(cfg){
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * __Note to typescript users__: You will need to specify the type parameters explicitly. The best way to do so is by
 * defining the interfaces for the classes separately:
 * ```typescript
 * interface BaseWidgetCfg {
 *  prop1: string;
 * }
 * interface AccordionPanelCfg extends BaseWidgetCfg {
 *   prop2: boolean;
 * }
 * interface BaseWidget {
 *   init(cfg: BaseWidgetCfg): void;
 *   method1(x: number): boolean;
 * }
 * interface Accordion extends BaseWidget {
 *   init(cfg: AccordionPanelCfg): void;
 *   method1(): boolean;
 *   method2(): boolean;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Now you can use it normally:
 * ```typescript
 * const BaseWidget = Class.extend<BaseWidget, [BaseWidgetCfg]>({
 *   init(cfg: BaseWidgetCfg) {
 *     // ...
 *   },
 *   method1(x: number): boolean {
 *     return x > 0;
 *   },
 * });
 * const Accordion = BaseWidget.extend<Accordion, [AccordionCfg]>({
 *   init(cfg: AccordionCfg) {
 *     this._super(cfg);
 *   },
 *   method1() {
 *     return !this._super(42);
 *   },
 *   method2() {
 *     return true;
 *   }
 * });
 * const base: BaseWidget = new BaseWidget({prop1: ""});
 * const accordion: Accordion = new Accordion({prop1: "", prop2: true});
 * base.method1(2);
 * accordion.method1();
 * accordion.method2();
