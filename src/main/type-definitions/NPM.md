## Type declarations

PrimeFaces is a global library that adds methods and constants t the global window scope. To use the type declarations
in a JavaScript or TypeScript file, use a
[triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#-reference-path-)
like this (must be at the top of the file):

```javascript
/// <reference types="primefaces" />

// Now your IDE or transpiler can issue a warning that "search" does not exist
// on a jQuery object. You can now also enjoy autocompletion.
PF("dataTable").jq.search("tbody td");
```
